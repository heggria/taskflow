# Changelog

All notable changes to pi-taskflow are documented here. This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

## [0.0.22] — 2026-06-10

> Dogfooding release. The `dogfood-full` self-audit taskflow (which itself
> exercises all 9 phase types + when/join/retry/budget/cache/eval/flow-def/
> loop/tournament/approval) ran against the codebase and surfaced these fixes.

### Added
- **Live auto-refresh for the `/tf runs` panel.** The run-history panel was a static snapshot taken when opened, so a background (detached) run's progress never updated while watching. It now polls run state on a 1s interval and re-renders only when a run's status/`updatedAt` actually changes — phase progress (including `map`/`parallel` `subProgress` like `24/24`) updates live. The user's selection follows the same `runId` across refreshes, a green `● live` tag shows while any run is running, and the refresh timer is cleared on close (`dispose()`) and `unref`'d so it never keeps the event loop alive. Fully backward-compatible: without live hooks the panel renders statically as before.
  - 5 new tests (`test/runs-view.test.ts`): refresh-on-change, no-render-when-unchanged, dispose-stops-timer, selection-follows-runId, back-compat-no-hooks.

### Fixed
- **`safeParse` now prefers a `json`-tagged fence in multi-fence output.** When an LLM phase emitted an evidence block (e.g. ```` ```typescript ````) *before* the ```` ```json ```` payload, the old single-match regex grabbed the first fence, failed to parse, and the balanced-bracket fallback was misled by braces in the prose — `safeParse` returned `undefined` and any downstream `map` phase failed with `'over' did not resolve to an array`. It now scans every fenced block and tries `json`-tagged ones first, then untagged. (3 new multi-fence tests.)
- **Unresolved interpolation refs are surfaced as phase warnings.** `interpolate()` returns `missing[]` (placeholders with no source), but the runtime discarded it on the main task path — so `{args.typo}` or a `{steps.x.output}` without `dependsOn` was silently left intact in the dispatched task. The `interpolate.ts` doc comment promised "a recorded warning" that no code produced. The runtime now logs `[taskflow] phase X: unresolved refs ...` and attaches the message to `PhaseState.warnings` (persisted in the run record, visible in `/tf runs`). Doc comment corrected to match.

## [0.0.21] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Per-step context pre-read in shorthand modes.** Single, chain, and tasks shorthand steps now accept `context` (file paths) and `contextLimit`, desugared directly onto the generated phases. This eliminates `O(N²)` file exploration without writing the full DSL. In parallel `tasks` mode all branches share the deduped union of step contexts; chain steps each carry their own context. A top-level `context` in chain mode produces a warning (no unsupported flow-level default). Context-file changes automatically invalidate phase caches.

### Fixed
- **Headless approval safety.** Approval phases now auto-reject (not auto-approve) when running in detached/background/CI mode, preventing silent bypass of human gates.
- **Step-reference validator accepts transitive ancestors.** The step-reference checker previously raised false positives on valid DAGs where dependencies span multiple levels of ancestry. Ancestor transitive closure is now fully resolved.

## [0.0.20] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Background (detached) execution — `detach: true`.** Run a taskflow in a detached child process without blocking the current session. Pass `detach: true` and get a `runId` back immediately; the flow executes in the background, persisting state to the store. Status polled via `/tf runs` and `resume` works as normal.
  - `extensions/detached-runner.ts` (new): lightweight child-process entry script — reads serialized context, calls `executeTaskflow`, persists terminal state.
  - `extensions/index.ts`: `detach: Boolean` parameter on the taskflow tool + child-process spawn logic (records PID in `RunState`).
  - `extensions/store.ts`: `RunState` gains `pid?: number` + `detached?: boolean` fields; `isProcessAlive(pid)` stale-PID helper.
  - Design: entry-point spawn wrapper — zero changes to the 1340-line `runtime.ts` core, no new phase type, no DSL version bump, fully backward-compatible.
  - Approval phases auto-reject in background mode. Idle watchdog kills stalled children. Stale PID detection via signal-0 probe.
  - 8 new tests (`test/detached.test.ts`): process-alive, PID persistence, end-to-end detached, crash→failed, resume after failure, stale PID, backward compat.

### Fixed
- `approvalView` initialization robustness: throws a clear error when the approval view module is unavailable, preventing silent failures in detached/background mode.

## [0.0.19] — 2026-06-10

### Documentation
- **Closed the SKILL coverage gap — the LLM can now author every shipped feature.** A schema-vs-SKILL.md audit (`docs/internal/skill-coverage-audit.md`, machine-checked + cross-adversarial reviewed) found several implemented + tested features that were undocumented in the LLM-facing skill, so the model never generated them. All ~46 user-facing schema fields are now documented across SKILL.md + configuration.md.
  - **SKILL.md**: phase-type table now lists all 9 types (added `loop`, `tournament`) with a “details” column pointing each to its section; new **Loop phases** (`until`/`maxIterations`/`convergence`) and **Tournament phases** (`variants`/`judge`/`mode`/`judgeAgent`) sections; `eval` (zero-token machine gate) and `onBlock: "retry"` (self-healing rework loop) folded into the Gate section; cross-run `cache` pointer + `optional` + static `branches` notes.
  - **SKILL.md**: new **Operating a run** section — run lifecycle (`running → completed/blocked/failed/paused`), cache-aware resume, when to resume vs. re-run, budget-mid-run behavior, and run inspection. Clarified action semantics (`define` vs `name`, save scope/collision, `verify`/`agents` actions).
  - **configuration.md**: new **§2.1 Context pre-reading** (`context`/`contextLimit` — resolution order, per-file 8000-char cap, 200k total cap) and **§8 Cross-run caching** (`cache.scope`, `ttl`, full `fingerprint` prefix table for git/glob/glob!/file/env). Fixed a stale “5 phase types” → 9 cross-file drift.
- Every documented JSON example validates against the live schema; all run-status/resume claims verified against the runtime (`blocked` is terminal; `paused`/`failed` are resumable). 560 tests pass, zero regression.

### CI
- GitHub Packages publish is now best-effort (`continue-on-error`) so an unscoped-package 404 there can never block the npm publish or the GitHub Release.

## [0.0.18] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Runtime dynamic sub-flows — `flow { def }`.** A `flow` phase may now carry an inline `def` (mutually exclusive with `use`) that is resolved at runtime — typically from an upstream phase's JSON output (`"def": "{steps.plan.json}"`) — validated, verified, and executed as a nested sub-flow. This is the declarative answer to code-mode `for`/`if`: a planner decides *at runtime* what work to spawn, and every generated plan is structurally checked (cycles / dangling refs / duplicate ids / dead-ends) before it spends a token.
  - Accepts a full Taskflow `{name,phases}`, a bare `phases` array, or `{phases:[...]}` (markdown ```json fences tolerated). Pure data — no `eval`.
  - **Iterative replanning**: pair with `loop` so round N's plan depends on round N-1's *result* (not a one-shot fan-out).
  - **Fail-open**: a malformed/invalid/unverifiable def never aborts the run — the phase resolves as a no-op with a `defError` diagnostic and upstream output is preserved. An empty `phases` array is a valid no-op.
  - New examples: `examples/dynamic-plan-execute.json`, `examples/iterative-replan.json`.

### Security
- **Hardening for runtime-generated (untrusted) sub-flows**, enforced only when content is LLM-authored:
  - Breadth caps: `MAX_DYNAMIC_PHASES` (100), `MAX_DYNAMIC_CONCURRENCY` (16, flow- and phase-level), `MAX_DYNAMIC_MAP_ITEMS` (200, fan-out truncated not blocked).
  - `cwd` containment: a generated phase cannot escape the run directory.
  - Budget clamp: a generated def's budget is clamped to `min(child, parent)` per dimension — it can only ever be tighter, never looser.
  - Nesting cap: `MAX_DYNAMIC_NESTING` (5) bounds inline self-spawning depth.
  - Prototype-pollution defense: inline defs are deep-cloned and `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` own-keys are stripped.
- Authored/saved flows (`use`) are unchanged and not subject to these dynamic caps.

### Notes
- 25 new tests (`test/flow-def.test.ts`); 560 total, zero regression. Design + two-round cross-adversarial review (engineering-risk / design-critic / architecture / security) recorded under `docs/internal/`.
